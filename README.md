# sqlalqemy-challenge

- Using sqlalchemy, the database in the sqlite file was reflected into a model using the automap_base() function. Classes for the two tables were determined and saved to variables for reference. A session was opened using the ORM function of sqlalchemy. A query were designed to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data. After making a Pandas dataframe, the pandas.plot function was used to make a plot of this precipitation data. Summary statistics were also printed out using Pandas.
- Queries were designed to count the stations and to count the amount of observations at each station to determine which was the busiest. Station 'USC00519281' was the busiest with 2772 observations. Queries to determine the low, high and average temperatures at this station were made. Finally, the last 12 months of temperature observations at this station were plotted as a histogram.
- Using sqlalchemy and Flask, an app was created. The same steps as above were taken to reflect the database into a model, reflect the tables, and save references. Flask was used to set up an app with a homepage and five routes. The last two routes allow the user to enter either a start date, or, a start and end date at the end of the url to retrieve temperature information for those specific dates. These dates are then converted into datetime objects to use in the queries.
